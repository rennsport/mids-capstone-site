Unlock the Power of Function Calling with SynthCall

Welcome to SynthCall, where reliable synthetic data generation meets advanced function-calling. Our platform revolutionizes the way large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned to incorporate function calling; ensuring efficiency, security, and precision in every query.

### Why Choose SynthCall?

1) __Enhanced Functionality__ With our generation pipeline, LLMs can execute user-defined functions with pinpoint accuracy. Function data can be tailored to your team's specific needs and use cases. This allows our platform to improve the logic and reliability of your LLMs thereby eliminating common pitfalls like hallucinations and the in-ability to access real-time data.

2) __Cost-Efficient AI__  Skip the need for larger, expensive LLMs. SynthCall generates high-quality synthetic data to fine-tune smaller, cost-effective models tailored to your needs while maintaining accuracy and reliability. 

3) __Data Privacy First:__ : With our on-prem pipeline, your sensitive data stays within your environment. By leveraging solutions like Ollama and AWS, we ensure robust security for all your data generation processes. At its core, SynthCall can function without the need for human generated data. For more information about how our pipeline handles your data you can read our [Infrastructure page](/infrastructure/).
